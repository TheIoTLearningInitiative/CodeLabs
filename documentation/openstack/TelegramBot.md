## Bot Revolution

> Bots are simply Telegram accounts operated by software – not people – and they'll often have AI features. They can do anything – teach, play, search, broadcast, remind, connect, integrate with other services, or even pass commands to the Internet of Things [Bot Revolution](https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution)
