# Low Cost Air Quality Sensor

Characteristics

- Sensitivity
- Proven Accuracy
- Location
- Unit? Range of gases, particulates and environmental conditions
- Secure
- Credibility
- Installation and Operation
- Remote Management
- High quality

## Particle Phase

> Larger particles (>0.1 μm)

Possible sensor measurement issues:

- Particle detection capability – transport of particles to sensor, sensor sensitivity
  - Some use a passive means to move air through sensing region; others have a fan.
- Signal translation to concentration estimate

## Gas Phase

> Metal oxide sensors

Possible sensor measurement issues:

- Interfering gases in mixture
- Measurement artifact due to temperature and humidity
- Eventual failure of sensor

> Electrochemical sensors

Possible sensor measurement issues:

- Interfering gases in mixture
- Measurement artifact due to temperature and humidity
- Eventual failure of sensor

> Photoionization sensors

Possible sensor measurement issues:

- Baseline drift
- Eventual failure of sensor based on 
lamp lifetime.
