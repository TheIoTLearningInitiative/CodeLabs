# Arquitecture

- Government - School - Company Sandbox Learning Project
- What is our top priority?
  - Unprecedented access to data on neighborhood-scale air quality 
  - Lower cost strategies to achieve air monitoring goals
  - Engagement with communities, schools, industry

Approaches

- Current Vs New
- Who collects the data?
- Why data are collected?
- How data are accessed?

Challenges

- Data interpretation and public messaging 
- “Big data” analysis
- Support for do-it-yourself/citizen science

# Air Measurement Technologies

- Traditional
  - Expensive instruments
  - Specialized training required
  - Large physical footprint
  - Large power draw
- Low Cost
  - Public demand
  - More personalized information
- Experimental
  - Do It Yourself

Desirable Direction

- Lower Cost Systems
- Higher Spatial Resolution

# Sensor Applications

- Stationary Mode
  - Source Fence line
  - Community measurements
  - e.g.
    - Multipollutant sensor stations in near road 
    - Community setting
- Mobile Mode
  - Personal monitoring
  - Community group monitoring
  - Mapping spatial trends
- Education Outreach
  - EPA ORD’s particle sensor kit
  - Instrumented kites measuring VOCs
  - Hacking fiber optic flowers to light up based on CO2 sensor readings (EPA ORD)

# Additional Factors

- Reliability of the manufacturing 
   - many are produced in batches
- Data communications
- Ease of operation 
- Power draw
- Lifetime of sensor 
  - some likely to fail within 1 year

# High Level Single Arquitecture

- Low-cost electrochemical sensors 
- Power
  - Internal via Battery
    - Solar
  - External via Landpower
- Communications
  - Cellular
  - Low Power Area Networks
  - WiFi
- Algorithms

# High Level Solution Arquitecture

Phase One

- 1 Low Cost Device + 2 Experimental Design
- A couple of Stations with Sensors deployed at X points
  - Sensor data compared to reference analyzer data
  - Low-cost sensors performed well


# High Level Development Plan

- Adquisition 
- Design
- Measurement
  - Preliminary observations (~1 week of data)


Controlled Laboratory Setting - challenge against interfering 
species, temperature/humidity effects, etc.
- Co-locate with a reference instrument
