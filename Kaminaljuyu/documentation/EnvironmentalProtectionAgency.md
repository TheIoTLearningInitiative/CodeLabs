## Sensors

- Research
- Personal Exposure Monitoring
- Supplementing Existing Monitoring
- Source Identification and Characterization
- Education
- Information/Awareness

## Before Collecting

- __Basics__
  - Purpose
    - Government - School - Company Sandbox Learning Project
  - Number of Pollutants
- __Monitor__
  - What sensor?
  - How often data collected?
  - Calibration
    - Calibration
    - Collocation
  - Additional data?
    - Noise
    - Temperature
- __Location__
  - Where?
    - Moving /Stationary
    - Indoor / Outdoor
  - Other Sources
    - Industry
    - Construction
  - Wheather Conditions
- __Data Analysis__

## Air Measurement Technologies

- Traditional
  - Expensive instruments
  - Specialized training required
  - Large physical footprint
  - Large power draw
- Low Cost
  - Public demand
  - More personalized information
- Experimental
  - Do It Yourself

Desirable Direction

- Lower Cost Systems
- Higher Spatial Resolution

## Sensor Applications

- Stationary Mode
  - Source Fence line
  - Community measurements
  - e.g.
    - Multipollutant sensor stations in near road 
    - Community setting
- Mobile Mode
  - Personal monitoring
  - Community group monitoring
  - Mapping spatial trends
- Education Outreach
  - EPA ORDâ€™s particle sensor kit
  - Instrumented kites measuring VOCs
  - Hacking fiber optic flowers to light up based on CO2 sensor readings (EPA ORD)

## Additional Factors

- Reliability of the manufacturing 
   - Many are produced in batches
- Data communications
- Ease of operation
- Power draw
- Lifetime of sensor
  - Some likely to fail within 1 year

# Evaluation of Emerging Air Pollution Sensor Performance

> The US EPA has focused a majority of its attention on sensors costing < $2,500.00 as it is
believed such a cost would be at the upper limit to that which citizen scientists, as well as many others might be able to afford.
