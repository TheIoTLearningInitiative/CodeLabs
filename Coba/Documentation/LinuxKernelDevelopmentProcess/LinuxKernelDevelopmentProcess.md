# Linux Kernel Development Process

> _The Linux kernel, at over 8 million lines of code and well over 1000 contributors to each release, is one of the largest and most active free software projects in existence.  Since its humble beginning in 1991, this kernel has evolved into a best-of-breed operating system component which runs on pocket-sized digital music players, desktop PCs, the largest supercomputers in existence, and all types of systems in between.  It is a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for almost any situation._

## Kernel Summit: Development process

> _For all practical purposes, the final topic of the 2004 Kernel Summit was the traditional discussion of the development process. This space is usually set aside as the time to pressure Linus for a deadline; often inquiring minds want to know when a feature freeze will happen, but the issue of interest this time was: when will the 2.7 series begin? The answer was somewhat difficult to interpret, but certainly surprising._ [Homepage](https://lwn.net/Articles/94386/)

## HOWTO do Linux kernel development

> This is the be-all, end-all document on this topic.  It contains
instructions on how to become a Linux kernel developer and how to learn
to work with the Linux kernel development community.  It tries to not
contain anything related to the technical aspects of kernel programming,
but will help point you in the right direction for that. [Homepage](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/process/howto.rst)
