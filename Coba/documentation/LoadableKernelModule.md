# Loadable Kernel Module

> A loadable kernel module (LKM) is a mechanism for adding code to, or removing code from, the Linux kernel at run time. They are ideal for device drivers, enabling the kernel to communicate with the hardware without it having to know how the hardware. [DerekMolloy](http://derekmolloy.ie/writing-a-linux-kernel-module-part-1-introduction/)

> In computing, a loadable kernel module (or LKM) is an object file that contains code to extend the running kernel, or so-called base kernel, of an operating system. LKMs are typically used to add support for new hardware (as device drivers) and/or filesystems, or for adding system calls. When the functionality provided by a LKM is no longer required, it can be unloaded in order to free memory and other resources. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loadable_kernel_module)
