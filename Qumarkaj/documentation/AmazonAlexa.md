# Amazon Alexa

> Alexa is an intelligent personal assistant developed by Amazon Lab126, made popular by the Amazon Echo. It is capable of voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, and other real time information. Alexa can also control several smart devices using itself as a home automation hub.[2] Most devices with Alexa allow users to activate the device using a wake-word (such as Echo); other devices require you to push a button to activate Alexa's listening mode. Currently, interaction and communication with Alexa is only available in English and German. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa)
