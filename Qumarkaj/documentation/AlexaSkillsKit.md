Examples of Alexa skills include the ability to play music, answer general questions, set an alarm or timer, and more. [Homepage](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit)

> The Alexa Skills Kit is a collection of self-service APIs, tools, documentation and code samples that make it fast and easy for you to add skills to Alexa. You can also use the Smart Home Skill API, a new addition to the Alexa Skills Kit, to easily teach Alexa how to control your cloud-controlled lighting and thermostat devices. All of the code runs in the cloud and nothing is on any user device.
