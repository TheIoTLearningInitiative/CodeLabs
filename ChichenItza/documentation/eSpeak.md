# eSpeak

> eSpeakNG is a compact open source software speech synthesizer for Linux, Windows and other platforms. It uses a formant synthesis method, providing many languages in a small size. Much of the programming for eSpeakNG's language support is done using rule files with feedback from native speakers. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESpeakNG)
