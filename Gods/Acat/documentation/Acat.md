# Acat

> The Maya placed great importance on the process of tattooing, believing that tattoos in the image of a god would imbue a person with some of that god's power. Because of the importance and difficulty of this art form it was only natural that there was a god responsible for it. Acat[pronunciation?] was said to bless the ink, needles, and work spaces, and steady the hands of the artists for better results. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acat_(deity))
