# Autopilot / Flight Stack

> A system used to control the trajectory of an aircraft without constant 'hands-on' control by a human operator being required. Autopilots do not replace human operators but assist them in controlling aircraft, allowing them to focus on broader aspects of operations such as monitoring the trajectory, weather and systems. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopilot)

- Inputs .. Sensors(IMU, Compass, Barometer, Somar, Cameras)
- Inputs .. User Commands
- Outputs .. Propeller Speeds

## Paparazzi UAV

> An open-source drone hardware and software project encompassing autopilot systems and ground station software for multicopters/multirotors, fixed-wing, helicopters and hybrid aircraft that was founded in 2003. Designed with autonomous flight as the primary focus and manual flying as the secondary. From the beginning it was designed with portability in mind and the ability to control multiple aircraft within the same system. Paparazzi features a dynamic flight plan system that is defined by mission states and using way points as “variables”. This makes it easy to create very complex fully automated missions without the operators intervention.
