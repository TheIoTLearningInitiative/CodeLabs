## FPV

> First Person View (FPV) flying is when you fly your radio aircraft using a wireless video feed and view it from the pilot's perspective using a FPV monitor or video goggles. It's the closest thing to flying without actually flying! [UnmannedTechShop](https://www.unmannedtechshop.co.uk/fpv/)

# Hardware

## Pixhawk

> Pixhawk is an independent, open-hardware project aiming at providing high-end autopilot hardware to the academic, hobby and industrial communities at low costs and high availability.

# Software

## NuttX Real-Time Operating System

> NuttX is a real-time operating system (RTOS) with an emphasis on standards compliance and small footprint. Scalable from 8-bit to 32-bit microcontroller environments, the primary governing standards in NuttX are Posix and ANSI standards.

# Projects

## Dronecode

> The Dronecode project delivers a collaborative and shared Open Source Platform for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVS). A neutral place where industry and community developers can contribute technology in order to reduce costs and time to market

- [Dronecode](https://www.dronecode.org/)

### Drone Application Development SDK

> This SDK should allow developers to create drone “applications” that can run on mobile devices (tablets, phones) and on-board companion computers, and that can also seamlessly integrate drones with cloud-based services. The SDK should ideally support Python, C++ and Android Developer APIs, including options like ROS, Cloud etc., and also integration with any simulation environment.

Mobile SDK

- DJI
- Parrot
- FlytOS
- DroneKit

OnBoard SDK

- DJI
- Parrot
- FlytOS
- DroneKit
- AirLib, Microsoft AirSim
