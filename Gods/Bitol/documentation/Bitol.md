# Hardware

## Pixhawk

> Pixhawk is an independent, open-hardware project aiming at providing high-end autopilot hardware to the academic, hobby and industrial communities at low costs and high availability.

# Software

## NuttX Real-Time Operating System

> NuttX is a real-time operating system (RTOS) with an emphasis on standards compliance and small footprint. Scalable from 8-bit to 32-bit microcontroller environments, the primary governing standards in NuttX are Posix and ANSI standards.

## QGroundControl

> Intuitive and Powerful Ground Control Station for PX4 and ArduPilot UAVs. QGroundControl provides full flight control and mission planning for any MAVLink enabled drone. It provides configuration for ArduPilot or PX4 Pro powered vehicles. Its primary goal is ease of use for first time and professional users. All the code is open-source source, so you can contribute and evolve it as you want.

- [QGroundControl Developer Guide](https://dev.qgroundcontrol.com/en/)
- [QGroundControl Github Source Code](https://github.com/mavlink/qgroundcontrol)

Architecture

- Platforms
  - QGroundControl runs on Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS and Android
- Autopilots
  - Supports multiple autopilots: PX4 Pro, ArduPilot or any vehicle that communicates using the MAVLink protocol
- Vehicles
  - Works with all vehicle types supported by PX4 Pro and ArduPilot (multi-rotor, fixed-wing, VTOL, etc.)

# Projects

## Dronecode

> The Dronecode project delivers a collaborative and shared Open Source Platform for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVS). A neutral place where industry and community developers can contribute technology in order to reduce costs and time to market

- [Dronecode](https://www.dronecode.org/)

### Drone Application Development SDK

> This SDK should allow developers to create drone “applications” that can run on mobile devices (tablets, phones) and on-board companion computers, and that can also seamlessly integrate drones with cloud-based services. The SDK should ideally support Python, C++ and Android Developer APIs, including options like ROS, Cloud etc., and also integration with any simulation environment.

Mobile SDK

- DJI
- Parrot
- FlytOS
- DroneKit

OnBoard SDK

- DJI
- Parrot
- FlytOS
- DroneKit
- AirLib, Microsoft AirSim
