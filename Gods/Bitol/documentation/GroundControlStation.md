# Ground Stations

> A ground control station (GCS) is a land- or sea-based control centre that provides the facilities for human control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or "drones"). It may also refer to a system for controlling rockets within or above the atmosphere, but this is discussed elsewhere. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_control_station)

## QGroundControl

> Intuitive and Powerful Ground Control Station for PX4 and ArduPilot UAVs. QGroundControl provides full flight control and mission planning for any MAVLink enabled drone. It provides configuration for ArduPilot or PX4 Pro powered vehicles. Its primary goal is ease of use for first time and professional users. All the code is open-source source, so you can contribute and evolve it as you want.
