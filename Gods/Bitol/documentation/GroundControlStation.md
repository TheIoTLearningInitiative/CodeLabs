# Ground Stations

> A ground control station (GCS) is a land- or sea-based control centre that provides the facilities for human control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or "drones"). It may also refer to a system for controlling rockets within or above the atmosphere, but this is discussed elsewhere. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_control_station)

> ___GCS Hardware__ refers to the complete set of ground-based hardware systems used to control the UAV. This typically includes the Human-Machine Interface, computer, telemetry, video capture card and aerials for the control, video and data links to the UAV.
