# Drone Solution Architect

> An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, is an aircraft without a human pilot aboard. UAVs are a component of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS); which include a UAV, a ground-based controller, and a system of communications between the two. The flight of UAVs may operate with various degrees of autonomy: either under remote control by a human operator or autonomously by onboard computers.

## FPV

> First Person View (FPV) flying is when you fly your radio aircraft using a wireless video feed and view it from the pilot's perspective using a FPV monitor or video goggles. It's the closest thing to flying without actually flying! [UnmannedTechShop](https://www.unmannedtechshop.co.uk/fpv/)
