## Samples

1. __My First Recon App__
   > This is a brief overview of the resources you'll need to develop apps for ReconOS, an Operating System that provides a powerful platform compatible with Android API level 16. Once you've familiarized yourself with our reference app and with the Recon SDK UI components, you should be comfortable enough to create your own Jet Pro app
2. __Web Connectivity__
  >  This guide offers a quick insight into the using the Web Connectivity API. Recon devices can get Internet access by connecting (via Bluetooth) to an iPhone or Android smartphone running the Engage app (iOS, Android). The web connectivity service allows your app to use this functionality easily, without knowing the type of smartphone connected to the Recon device. In this sample, we’ll show you how to use the Web Connectivity API to download and upload files. We’ll cover two types of file downloads, including one involving an image. For our upload example, we’ll use the HTTP request and response service httpbin.org to test the upload process.
3. __Heading__
   > This guide offers a quick insight into the using the
Heading API. This sample will show how to use the heading service to determine the orientation of the user’s head. Our sample compass app contains a single activity, CompassActivity, which shows the compass’ user interface and updates that interface with the correct heading. Note that, since pitch and roll values aren’t needed in a compass, our sample app retrieves only yaw values.
