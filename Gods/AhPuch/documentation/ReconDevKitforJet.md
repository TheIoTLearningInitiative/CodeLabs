## Samples

1. My First Recon App
   > This is a brief overview of the resources you'll need to develop apps for ReconOS, an Operating System that provides a powerful platform compatible with Android API level 16. Once you've familiarized yourself with our reference app and with the Recon SDK UI components, you should be comfortable enough to create your own Jet Pro app
2. Web Connectivity
  >  This guide offers a quick insight into the using the Web Connectivity API. Recon devices can get Internet access by connecting (via Bluetooth) to an iPhone or Android
smartphone running the Engage app (iOS, Android). The web connectivity service allows your app to use this functionality easily, without knowing the type of smartphone connected to the Recon device. In this sample, we’ll show you how to use the Web Connectivity API to download and upload
files. We’ll cover two types of file downloads, including one involving an image. For our upload example, we’ll use the HTTP request and response service httpbin.org to test the upload process.
