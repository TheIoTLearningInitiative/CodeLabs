# Edzna

> Edzn√° is a Maya archaeological site in the north of the Mexican state of Campeche. The site is open to visitors. The most remarkable building at the plaza is the main temple. Built on a platform 40 m high, it provides a wide overview of the surroundings. Another significant building located in the plaza is a ball court. Two parallel structures make up the ball court. The top rooms of the ball court were possibly used to store images of the gods associated with the events, along with items needed for the games [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edzna)
